#include "libft.h"

libft is the first project in the common core curriculum at 42 school. It's an individual project that aims to recreate a collection of the standard C library functions, along with additional ones to manage strings, memory, lists, and more.

Over time, we've continued to expand this library with new functions from our subsequent projects, making libft an indispensable tool throughout our journey at the 42 school.


To compile the library, use "make"

This will compile the .c files in srcs/ into .o files, and then compile these .o files into the library libft.a.

You can then link the libft.a library to your project.

The full list of functions can be found within the srcs/ directory.
